What is Customer Churn?

According to Shewta at [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-customer-churn), Customer churn is one of the most important mertics for a growing business to evaluate. This number can give any company the hard truth about its cutomer retention.

It means that the customer churn prediction is a process used by businesses to predict which customer are at the risk of ending their relationship with the company or the company's product.

My goal was to identify which customer is likely to churn, on old dataset from which we can get some meaningful insights and inturn forecast which customer might leave the bank or that service. By predicting churn, companies can practise customer retention stategies, to drecrease the chance of the customer leaving them.

Customer churn strategies is commonly employed in various industires, including banks, e-commerce, subscription-based services, etc, where customer retention is crucial for maintaining profits and growth.

For my customer churn prediction model, I used artificial neural network machine learning algorithm.

Now the question arises, how do we retain customers. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2017/09/05/the-4-keys-to-boosting-your-customer-retention/?sh=393a6c925640), the best methods are :

- **Know your customers better than they know themselves**
  
  Customer's satisfaction and ratings plummet, when they feel that they are being ignored. A good strategy would be to take some time to create relationsips with the customers   and get to know them, and their needs. This could go a long way.
  
- **Implement feedback systems**

  A good strategy for customer retention is to allow them to spead for themselves. Short but precise surveys or feedback from their loyal customer will help you know how they    feel about the company or the product. Rewarding them after a feedback can prove them that you value their time and comments.
  
- **Go beyond nice and polite**

  There's an old saying: 
  
- **Provide anticipatory service**
